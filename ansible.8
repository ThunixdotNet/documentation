.SH NAME
Ansible on Thunix \- how we manage the server 
.SH SYNOPSIS
ansible-pull
.SH DESCRIPTION
We use ansible to manage the servers running the systems and services for Thunix.  Ansible consists of a "playbook" of YAML files, that declare the state of the system.

The first step is to clone the repo used to manage the environment:

git clone git@ttm.sh:thunix/ansible.git
(You will need a tidegit account for this, and a key loaded into your account there)

From there, the typical github-type workflow is used:

* Create a local branch, to track your issue's changes.

* Commit changes to your local branch.

* Send a URI pointing to your repo, with branch name to someone with merge permissions

Inside of the tildegit interface:

* Create a new branch, selecting option to create a branch and pull request

* Make changes in your branch

* Update PR

* Wait for someone to merge your changes

Hourly, a job runs that pulls the latest version of the repo, and the runs ansible-playbook against the playbook.  A sudoer can manually run this job, if desired, and it's located at /etc/cron.hourly/ansible-pull.
